Hey,  
Iâ€™m going around endorsing people for skills they want highlighted. It helps with job search, believe it or not, as HR reps look for these skill sets on Linkedin. So figure it makes sense for everyone to help each other.  
What skills would you want to be endorsed for?   
If you've got a sec, could you in turn endorse my profile for these skills:  
-Cyber Security 
-Information Security 
-Network Architecture 
-Cyber Law 
-Ethical Hacker 
-Regular Expressions 
Trying to boost these babies to the top. Inbox me know what you need to be endorsed for.
